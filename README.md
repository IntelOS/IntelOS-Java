LuminaryOS is a virtual operating system written in Java. It provides a simple and easy to use development & user experience! LuminaryOS is designed to be a lightweight and portable virtual operating system that can run on a variety of platforms.

## STATUS: ONGOING
## Getting Started
To get started with LuminaryOS, you will need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Java from the Oracle website.

``` 

Once you have verified you have Java 17+ simply run
